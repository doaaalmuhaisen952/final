          <h2> The Scream by Edvard Munch
          </h2>
          <p> A painting that symbolises the anguish and pain of modern life. It has become one of the most famous
            pictures of modern times. Somehow it makes me think of Freud and looking at our subconscious. It is famous,
            but is it good? Why look at the mud in the lily pond, when you can enjoy the lilies on top?</p>

          <h2> The Last Supper </h2>

          <p>Leonardo da Vinci paints one of the most famous scenes in the Bible – The Last Supper. It is after Christ
            has said one of the disciples will betray him. This is the ultimate soap opera – the ultimate test of man –
            who will we serve, God or Mammon? This is why we are fascinated by the scene, how would we have behaved at
            the table of Jesus Christ? </p>

          <h2> The Girl With a Pearl Earring
          </h2>

          <p>Jan Vermeer painted this iconic portraits (somewhat reminiscent of the Mona Lisa) and is a beautiful
            example of the Baroque style and the use of light. The age of the girl is deceptively hard to fathom. On the
            one hand, the beautiful lustrous eyes suggest the innocence of childhood. On the other hand, there are
            touches of a girl on the threshold of womanhood. It creates a dynamic of purity, innocence and the
            inevitable change of growing into womanhood.</p>

          <h2> Le Moulin de la Galette
          </h2>

          <p>A leading impressionist, Auguste Renoir captures the buzz and excitement of this outdoor scene in Paris. It
            is Paris at the turn of the Century – a time when Paris was a leading cultural centre of the world, but
            essentially a place where people were having a good time, enjoying life </p>

          <h2> Poppies in a Field by Claude Monet

          </h2>

          <p>Claude Monet is one of the great impressionist painters. This beautiful pastoral scene encapsulates the
            essence of how the impressionists captured the beauty and simplicity of nature. It also captures that
            pre-industrialist age, which was fast disappearing during Monet’s life. It is an evocation of a bye-gone
            era. It is hard not to feel nostalgic about this scene. Notice also how the humans are but a sideshow to the
            overall picture. </p>
